My vscode theme uses a slightly modified version of synthwave fluoromachine to stop the animations and adds glow and transparency with "vibrancy continued" and glassit.

After updating VSCode, run and restart the editor: 
1) Enable Vibrancy
2) Reload Custom CSS and JS

You'll get a notice saying something is corrupted which can be ignored.
