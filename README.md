My vscode theme uses a slightly modified version of synthwave fluoromachine to stop the animations and adds glow and slight transparency with glassit.

After updating VSCode, run and restart the editor. Then run `Reload Custom CSS and JS`.

You'll get a notice saying something is corrupted which can be ignored.

Here's a list of css selectors to further customize the colors in `extensions\thecodemonkey.synthwave-x-fluoromachine-epic-animations-1.4.13\themes\synthwave-x-fluoromachine.json`:
